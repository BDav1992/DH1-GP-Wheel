# DH1 GP Wheel (V0.9)

My sketch for DH1 GP Wheel.

How to use:

1) Upload the Clutch_Tester sketch to your wheel's Arduino. After that open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE. In released state read the values for the left and right clutch then pull both the clutches to the maximum and read the values now.

2) Open the DH_GP1 file. On the clutch tab you can modify the values of the clutches. Write in the previously read values then upload the sketch to the Arduino in your wheel. You can also modify the usage of the clutches. See in the sketch.
